# Keras RetinaNet
Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

## Status
* Currently, correct training has been achieved on a very simple dataset (a single black image with a white square on it, see [this Notebook](https://gist.github.com/hgaiser/a2c053ce8dfdd6a829e56c4b3ede5ad3)). 
* Only classification has been implemented and tested. Regression is mostly in place, but has low priority since it's pointless to try and fix it when classification is not working properly.
* No postprocessing, such as non-maximum suppression, has been implemented yet. Again, this is depending on correctly trained networks, so it has low priority.
* In order to get classification to work, the finest pyramid level (P3 in the paper) was disabled. Presumably this level introduces too many background anchors, causing unstable training. The exact reason and correct fix for this is not yet found.
* As of writing, this repository depends on an unmerged PR of `keras-resnet`. For now, it can be installed by manually installing [this](https://github.com/delftrobotics-forks/keras-resnet/tree/expose-intermediate) branch.

Any and all contributions to this project are welcome.
